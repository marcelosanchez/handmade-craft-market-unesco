Pull requests and issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/helenhousandi/admin-color-schemer) welcome.

== Installation ==

Admin Color Schemer is most easily installed automatically via the Plugins tab in your dashboard. Your uploads folder also needs to be writeable in order to save the scheme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I have to click a button to preview? =

The preview currently operates by generating a complete stylesheet and reloading it. While in some environments this happens near-instantaneously, the time and resources it takes to reflect a change are not ideal for live previews. We do hope to solve this in a later release.

= I'm getting an ugly screen asking me for a username and password. =

This means that your uploads folder requires credentials in order to save the the scheme files. If you're not sure how to fix that, please try the [support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/). We'll also work on making this prompt more beautiful in the future.
