Easily add custom profile tabs to your Ultimate Member user profiles.

== Description ==

**Features:**

For each custom tab you can:

- Set the name and icon of the tab
- Set the position of tab
- Control which user roles have the tab
- Control which user roles can see the tab
- Make the tab private (only visible to profile owner)
- Make the profile nav bar button redirect to a custom URL
- Create subnavs

You can also output any field that a member has added to their profile using the following shortcode:

`[pp-tabs field=meta_key]`

or, to display the field label as well:

`[pp-tabs field=meta_key label=1]`
